PROJECT SUMMARY - 
The aim of this project was to learn how FlexMeasures, an open-source platform for energy flexibility management can be used to optimize a Photovoltaic (PV) system and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in a grid connected Microgrid. The objective was to minimize the energy cost while ensuring that the energy demand was met.
The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to optimize the paper's new energy management strategy, which determined the ideal PV power and BESS capacity levels that reduced energy costs. As using energy from the grid is thought to be very expensive and is regarded a penalty if it surpasses a particular quantity, the paper focuses mostly on islanding mode rather than grid linked mode. Consequently, there is a grid cost restriction. Particles in the plane indicate the PV and BESS module counts (or sizes) and are utilized in PSO to determine the system's least cost.
Overall, the project showed how well the PSO algorithm and FlexMeasures work for optimizing PV and BESS systems. The outcomes demonstrated that the optimized system could satisfy energy demand while lowering energy costs, helping to create a more sustainable and effective energy system (I was unable to verify this; it is my assumption).
